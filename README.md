# Android Sample Keyboard

This is a sample keyboard coded from [instructions at Android City](https://www.androidauthority.com/lets-build-custom-keyboard-android-832362). I found the text to be confusing, so I followed the embedded video, which is at [youtu.be/8DeQk0wlFyM](https://youtu.be/8DeQk0wlFyM).

The code is currently incomplete. I stopped [at 20:19](https://youtu.be/8DeQk0wlFyM?start=1219) in the video.
